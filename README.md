# python-summation
One of the older projects I did in college.
Program that uses a predefined set of numbers to sum up numbers in range (n+1) where n is one of the predefined numbers. 
It will measure the time needed to complete the summation while using one thread, multiple threads, multiple processes and number of processes based 
on number of CPUs which the executing machine has. Then it will calculate the median of every case and put everything up into html report together with execution environment info.
